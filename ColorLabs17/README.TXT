Picture 1 Avengers- For the first picture I just used the copy method to copy the original picture, which was the avengers, onto the large canvas and I wrote the image onto the file "images/collage.jpg".
Picture 2 Avengers- For the second picture I simply used the negate method and the mirror vertical method and then copied it onto the collage and saved it.

Picture 7 Avengers- For the last picture of the avengers I inlarged the image to fill the empty space in the collage, and then copied it onto the collage and saved it.
Picture Ironman- For the first picture of ironman I just copied the orginal image onto the collage ontop of the inlarged avengers photo. I used multiple effects on this image, such as grey scale and on the last one inlargment etc. Then I saved them onto the collage to cover the strip above the avengers photo.
